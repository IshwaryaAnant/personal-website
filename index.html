							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>I completed my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT in 2015, followed by an M.Eng. from MIT in 2016. While I have worked on a variety of projects in the past, I am currently interested in signal processing, embedded systems, and digital design, specifically as they intersect with audio and music.  I am presently pursuing a PhD in the Responsive Environments group at the MIT Media Lab, under the mentorship of Professor Joe Paradiso. Outside of research, I enjoy singing, playing instruments, writing, composing, and acting.</p>

									<h3>Self-folding Robotics</h3>
									<p>A year-long research project, conducted as part of the 2013-2014 SuperUROP program, was based on the notion that robots might one day have the capacity to assemble themselves.

							<h2>Assistive Technology Club & Hackathon</h2>
							<!-- <p> <b>Assistive Technology Club/ Hackathon</b> </p> -->
							<p>In my last few years here at MIT, Assistive Technologies is a space that has become particularly close to my heart. After being inspired by Professor Seth Teller and his incredible class on designing AT (6.811), I worked closely with a team of students to organize ATHack 2014, MIT's first Assistive Technologies Hackathon! And we haven't looked back since.  With the completion of ATHack 2017, the hack is now in its 5th year. The aim of both the class and the hackathon is to bring together "clients" in the community who live with disabilities and student engineers to work towards innovative solutions.</p>

							<h2>Music & Writing</h2>
							<!-- <p> <b>Assistive Technology Club/ Hackathon</b> </p> -->
							<p><b>Classical Indian Music</b></p>
							<p> Music is perhaps my biggest passion. I've been learning and singing Carnatic music since I was five or six years old, and I have always been captivated by the artform's expressive nature and lyrical beauty. It has provided me with a sense of comfort, an avenue of relaxation, and a bridge into a past rich with culture, tradition, and faith. I also enjoy singing lighter forms of classical music, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhajan">Bhajans</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qawwali">Qawwalis</a>, and will gladly drop anything to join in on jam sessions with friends and family.</br>
							Over the years, I've learned to play a variety of instruments including the piano, violin, harmonium, and naal (a cousin of the tabla). My favorite class of instruments to play, however, has always been percussion. </p>
							<p>Some recent performances across genres: <a href="https://youtu.be/TlzUPi4xiec?t=52m42s">Krishnashtami 2016</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/ovABrIF_zlA?t=1h14m32s">SSE Alumni Musical 2016</a>, <a href="">Sruthi Laya TCD 2015</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=813otvGqGqw">MIT C-Show 2016</a></p>
							<p><b>A cappella</b></p>
							<p> My freshman year at MIT, I joined a South Asian fusion a capella group known as the <a href="http://ohms.mit.edu">MIT Ohms</a>, and have had the chance to experiment with arranging music, directing the group, and collaborating on studio recordings.</p>
							<p> Some (older) recordings: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4puAjOLugBaeWuU9BYMavP">Saiyyan</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3KfNr2dVMsQlK07SpfIbSJ">Someone Like You (Arr.)</a> </p>
							<p><b>Song Writing/ Composing</b></p>
							<p>I'm quite fond of song writing and have dabbled more in it after encouragement from some of my professors at MIT.</p>
							<p>Some recent recordings: <i>To Be Uploaded Soon!</i></p>
							<p><b>Writing</b></p>
							<p>Many of my friends know me as perpetually having my head buried in a journal, scribbling down some thought or other. I've loved writing short stories since I was in elementary school, and after taking several fantastic creative writing classes here at MIT, I've had the opportunity to refine my writings and grow as an author. I have also recently enjoyed writing a bit of poetry. Some of my recent writing was awarded one of MIT's Ilona Karmel prizes as well. </p>
